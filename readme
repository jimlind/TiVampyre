edit ./config/tivampyre.json

tivampyre_mak (Media Access Key)
--------------------------------
This is the magic ID that tells your TiVo that the person trying to interact
with it is actually a person with physical access to the device.

Find it via:
TiVo Central -> Messages and Set Up -> Account and System Information

tivampyre_comskip_path (Commercial Skip Executable Path)
--------------------------------------------------------
This should be where comskip.exe and compskip.ini are found on your server.  I
like to keep that stuff in /opt/ and some people like to keep in is the
/usr/local/bin/ directory.  Doesn't matter to me.

Include trailing slash.

tivampyre_working_directory (Working Directory)
-----------------------------------------------
This should be where everything is going to be downloaded to and processed from.
Where the finished products will also be found. Everything will get stored here,
nothing in the /tmp/ directory.

Include trailing slash.
