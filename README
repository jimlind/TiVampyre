TiVampyre: Your TiVo Vampire

Designed as a PHP front-end to a TiVo Ripping Service.
Lots of Dependencies, everything is as well documented as it needs to be.
Built/Tested for a server running Debian Squeeze and a Series 3 TiVo.
Built/Tested for Chrome/Safari based browsers.

See the 'docs' folder for licenses and other goodies.
Built on the CodeIgniter framework, so it is included.

------ Installation Directions ------

** LAMP STACK**
First things first, you'll need a proper LAMP stack.  After your SQL server
is installed grab the SQLCREATES file from docs and create/import as desired

> sudo aptitude install apache2
> sudo a2enmod rewrite
> sudo aptitude install mysql-server
> sudo aptitude install php5
> sudo aptitude install php5-mysql
> sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

** SYSTEM TOOLS **
You'll need some additional tools to help find and download from your TiVo.

> sudo aptitude install avahi-utils
> sudo aptitude install curl

** TIVODECODE **
You'll need to decode the files from the TiVo to something useful.  You might
be able to find a binary of this, but I prefer to build from source.  It's easy.
Download the source then follow the commands.

> sudo aptitude install gcc
> sudo aptitude install make
> cd ~
> wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/tivodecode/tivodecode/0.2pre4/tivodecode-0.2pre4.tar.gz
> tar -xzvf tivodecode-0.2pre4.tar.gz
> cd tivodecode-0.2pre4/
> sudo ./configure
> sudo make
> sudo make install

** MULTIMEDIA TOOLS **
You'll need the utilities to read and encode the video files.  The files
available in the standard debian repository are hampered by copyright and other
restrictions, but you can still get the goodies.
Visit: //www.debian-multimedia.org/ then edit your /etc/apt/sources.list file
appropriatly.  Now update your sources and install.

> sudo aptitude update
> sudo aptitude install debian-multimedia-keyring
> sudo aptitude update
> sudo aptitude install mplayer
> sudo aptitude install mencoder

** WINE AND COMSKIP **
You'll need the Comskip utility (and thusly Wine) to detect and skip
commercials in your files.  Comskip isn't perfect, but it works well.  Download
the entire zip file and extract to an easy to remember location.  Most people
will say stash it in /usr/local/bin/comskip/ but I prefer to keep it in
the /opt/comskip/ directory.

(ComSkip is still actively maintained, look for newer versions)
You may need to install unzip to decompress the files (see below).

> sudo apt-get install unzip

ComSkip is a Windows Utility so it won't work natively in Linux.  Wine happens
to run this command line tool quite well.

> sudo apt-get install wine

** ATOMICPARSLEY **
AtomicParsley is used to write back the file metadata back to the mp4.  Nice
if you are going to be using iTunes to organize things.

> sudo apt-get install atomicparsley

** CRON JOBS ***
Give CRON access to all the bins
Every 15 minutes it should check the TiVo to update the shows it knows exist.
Every 5 minutes it should attempt to take the next step in video processing.

> crontab -e

|  PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
|  */5 * * * * php /var/www/index.php job run >/dev/null 2>&1
|  */15 * * * * php /var/www/index.php update >/dev/null 2>&1


** LIGHTTPD **
You'll need to get the videos off your server as well.  My favorite way is to
stream the mp4s via the H264 Steaming Mod in lighttpd.  Two HTTP daemons on the
same box isn't for the faint of heart, but it is fun.

Adapted from:
http://h264.code-shop.com/trac/wiki/Mod-H264-Streaming-Lighttpd-Version2

Basically, you'll stop apache (lighttpd wants port 80 too), then get lighttpd
from apt, then download some files, then rebuild lighttpd with the mod, then
edit some of the settings, and start apache again.

> sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
> sudo apt-get install lighttpd
> sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
> cd ~
> wget http://h264.code-shop.com/download/lighttpd-1.5.0_mod_h264_streaming-2.2.9.tar.gz
> tar -xzvf lighttpd-1.5.0_mod_h264_streaming-2.2.9.tar.gz
> cd lighttpd-1.5.0/
> sudo ./configure
> sudo make
> sudo make install

Edit /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
|  server.modules = ( 
|    ...,
|    "mod_h264_streaming"
|  )
|  h264-streaming.extensions = (".mp4")
|  server.port = 82
|  server.document-root = "/disk2/tivo"
|  #include_shell "/usr/share/lighttpd/use-ipv6.pl"

Edit /etc/init.d/lighttpd
|  DAEMON=/usr/local/sbin/lighttpd

> sudo killall -9 lighttpd
> sudo /etc/init.d/lighttpd start
> sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start
